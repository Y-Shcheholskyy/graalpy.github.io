Your new website is ready!

You can serve the website locally with

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --port 8082
```

and visit it at http://127.0.0.1:8082. 

From here, youâ€™re ready to continue developing the site on your own. 
All of the normal Jekyll commands are available to you, but you should prefix them with 
`bundle exec` so that Bundler runs the version of Jekyll that is installed in your project folder.
