## Using PyCharm with GraalPy

You can use PyCharm with the GraalPy default environment. 

1. Install PyCharm. (For more information, see [Install PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html).)

2. Create, or open, a Python project.
(For more information, see [Create a Python project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-empty-project.html), or [Open, reopen, and close projects](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/open-projects.html), respectively.)

3. Create a new _venv_ virtual environment for your Python project.
(For more information, see [Create a virtualenv environment](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html#python_create_virtual_env).)

4. Install packages by following the PyCharm instructions.
(For more information, see [Install, uninstall, and upgrade packages](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installing-uninstalling-and-upgrading-packages.html).)

5. Use the PyCharm menu items to [run your Python application](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/running-applications.html). 
Alternatively, use the terminal emulator to run the `graalpy` command (for more information, see [Running a Python Application](/guides/running_a_python_application/)).

6. You cannot use PyCharm to debug your Python application.
Instead, follow these instructions: [Debugging a Python Application](Debugging_a_Python_Application.md).
