## Using Visual Studio Code with GraalPy

You can use GraalPy in Visual Studio (VS) Code to create, install packages, and run your Python applications.
 
1. Instal VS Code and the Python Extension, following the instructions here: [Install Visual Studio Code and the Python Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-visual-studio-code-and-the-python-extension).

2. Create, or open, a Python file.

3. Create a new _venv_ virtual environment.
(For more information, see [Creating environments](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_creating-environments)).

4. Install packages by following the VS Code instructions.
(For more information, see [Install and use packages](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-and-use-packages).)

5. Use the VS Code menu items to run your Python application (for more information, see [Run Hello World](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_run-hello-world).)
Alternatively, use a Python terminal emulator to run the `graalpy` command (for more information, see [Running a Python Application](Running_a_Python_Application.md)).

6. You cannot use VS Code to debug your Python application.
Instead, open a VS Code Python terminal emulator and follow these instructions: [Debugging a Python Application](Debugging_a_Python_Application.md).
