title: Welcome to GraalPy!

GraalPy provides a Python 3.10 compliant runtime.
A primary goal is to support PyTorch, SciPy, and their constituent libraries, as well as to work with other data science and machine learning libraries from the rich Python ecosystem.

GraalPy can usually execute pure Python code faster than CPython, and nearly match CPython performance when C extensions are involved.
While many workloads run fine, any Python program that uses external packages could hit something unsupported.
At this point, the Python implementation is made available for experimentation and curious end-users.

See the [FAQ](FAQ.md) for commonly asked questions about this implementation.
